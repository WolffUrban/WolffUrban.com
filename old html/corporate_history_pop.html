              The paths of Philip Maritz and Lew Wolff, both real estate investors/developers 
              and St. Louis natives, crossed in 1992 and led to a breakfast meeting 
              at The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in St. Louis, where they discussed collaborating 
              on potential investment projects. Two years later they formed the 
              hotel investment group, Maritz, Wolff &amp; Co., and acquired The 
              Ritz-Carlton, St. Louis. Following the investment, through an innovative 
              approach to ownership, Maritz, Wolff worked with The Ritz-Carlton&#8217;s 
              management team to increase the property&#8217;s revenues by 14 
              percent and operating profits by 127 percent. During this period, 
              the partners observed factors in the hotel industry indicating strong 
              investment opportunities for top-tier urban and resort lodging properties. 
              This led to the creation of the Hotel Equity Fund, L.P. which today 
              has nearly $500 million in invested equity capital and asset values 
              in excess of $1.5 billion.</p>
            <p class="copy">In October 1997, Maritz, Wolff acquired a 50 percent 
              ownership in the five-star Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas and 
              a 50 percent ownership in Rosewood Hotels and Resorts, LLC. Rosewood 
              Hotels and Resorts is among the world&#8217;s premier luxury hotel 
              management companies. Rosewood&#8217;s portfolio of luxury hotels
              and resorts includes award winning hotels; among them: The Carlyle,
              New York; The Mansion on Turtle Creek, Dallas; Las Ventanas, Los
              Cabos, Mexico; and Little Dix Bay, British Virgin Islands; The
              Seiyo Ginza, Tokyo.</p>
            <p class="copy">In March 1998, Maritz, Wolff purchased a 50% interest 
              in three more premier hotel properties -- The San Francisco Fairmont, 
              The New Orleans Fairmont Hotel and The Dallas Fairmont Hotel. In 
              addition to the hotel assets, Maritz, Wolff acquired a 50 percent 
              stake in Fairmont Hotel Management Company, which manages landmark 
              hotels including the Plaza Hotel, New York; Fairmont Copley Plaza, 
              Boston; and Fairmont Hotels in San Jose and Chicago.</p>

            <p class="copy">In April 1999, Maritz, Wolff &amp; Co., with its partner 
              Kingdom Hotels (USA) Ltd., on behalf of Fairmont Hotels Management 
              LP, entered into an agreement with Canadian Pacific Limited and 
              its wholly owned subsidiary, Canadian Pacific Hotels &amp; Resorts, 
              Inc. to create a new management company, Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts, 
              Inc. and to grow the Fairmont Hotel brand internationally.</p>
            <p class="copy">The
              merger,
              finalized
              in October
              1999, combined
              the management
              of two
              prestigious
              hotel groups
              and created
              a collection
              of luxury
              hotels
              across
              North America,
              Mexico
              and the
              Caribbean.
              The merger
              combined
              eight landmark

              Hotels

              and Chateau
              Lake Louise.
              The new

              company
              also includes
