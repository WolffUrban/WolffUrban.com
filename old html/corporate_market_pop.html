              The extended down turn in the real estate and hotel industries during 
              the late 1980s, early 1990s, and again in the early 2000s prompted 
              many investors to steer clear of luxury hotels. Over-building, over-investment 
              and over-financing by developers and lenders unfamiliar with the 
              hotel industry created an oversupply of available hotel rooms resulting 
              in reduced room rates, low occupancy levels and distressed properties. 
              The depressed overall economy also caused pessimism in the hotel 
              industry due to lack of available capital and lower property values.</p>
            <p class="copy">In the midst of this declining hotel economy, Maritz 
              and Wolff saw an opportunity to invest in and apply their value-added 
              ownership approach to urban and resort hotel properties. Understanding 
              that investment in under-performing, full-service luxury urban and 
              resort hotel properties is most attractive just prior to a market&#8217;s 
              recovery (while capital still is limited and competition is scarce), 
              they designed their investment strategy to target selected top-tier 
              properties to which they could add value at just the right time.</p>
            <p class="copy">With the Hotel Equity Fund, Maritz, Wolff has acquired
               18 luxury urban and resort hotels in the United States, Canada,
               Asia-Pacific and the Caribbean, with a current total of 6,000
              hotel  rooms generating in excess of $700 million in annual revenues.
              The  portfolio of luxury hotels and resorts has a combined asset
              value  in excess of $1.5 billion and is comprised of properties
              operated  by Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, Fairmont, and Rosewood.
              Through active oversight and asset management, Maritz, Wolff has
              maximized cash flow while maintaining and enhancing long-term asset
              value. Improved bottom-lines at Maritz, Wolff owned assets have
              translated into attractive annual returns on investment (via cash
              distributions) for Maritz, Wolff investors, plus equity returns
              in excess of the firms targeted 25% IRR objective.</p>
