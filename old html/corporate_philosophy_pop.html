              Maritz, Wolff&#8217;s mandate is three-fold: (1) purchase prime 
              hotel and resort properties according to strict selection criteria; 
              (2) work with the managers to improve the hotel&#8217;s bottom line 
              performance, thereby producing attractive returns for their investors; 
              and (3) re-invest strategically in physical assets. The partners 
              believe that by working directly and cooperatively with a hotel&#8217;s 
              management company to enhance revenues and reduce costs, they can 
              maximize investment returns by adding significant value to properties.</p>
            <p class="copy">From experience prior to forming Maritz, Wolff, Lew 
              Wolff had an intimate knowledge of the hotel industry via his ownership 
              of Hilton and Holiday Inn franchises in California, while Philip 
              Maritz had a unique understanding of the marketing and sales issues 
              facing top-tier hotel properties from his experience with Maritz 
              Inc., a $2 billion, privately held, world leader in the incentive 
              and corporate travel industry. Together, they established a series 
              of unique principles that guide their decisions as to which properties 
              to purchase and how to maximize the values inherent in each of their 
              top-tier investments.</p>
            <p class="copy">These key principles reflect both Maritz, Wolff&#8217;s 
              business strategy as well as its competitive advantage:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="left">Retain the existing management team, working 
                cooperatively with them to enhance revenues and reduce costs.</span></li>
              <li><span class="left">Aggressively add value to the properties 
                by applying a hand-on systematic approach to asset management.</span></li>
              <li><span class="left">Make strategic capital investments in portfolio
                  hotels which yield attractive incremental returns.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
